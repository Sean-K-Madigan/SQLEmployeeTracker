  # Employee Tracker - SQL
  ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

  ## Project Description
  
  The purpose of this challenge was to learn how to create and access a PostgreSQL database that allowed a user to track their employees and important employmnent data such as salary, department, and manager. This program will allow small business owners to have all of their important employee data at hand so they can more effectively budget their labor expenses. I learned how to separate my files and import them where they were needed following best practices and I learned how to make database queries.
